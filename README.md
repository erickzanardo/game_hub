# game_hub

This repository implements a simple application supposed to be a Game Hub from Game Studio.

It includes very simple features where users can log in and get games available to them.

It was created so I could learn about Riverpod being used in a simpler, more controlled, but
still closer to real life application example.

This was created for learning purposed, but, Hopefully this template can help others.
